# Jupyter Notebook on Mybinder

I'm using mybinder as a virtual jupyter notebook to execute my python code for learning purpose. In order to get the numby, pandas working, need to set-up the env via the requirements.txt to get the correct library for my python code to work.

### Notes
pd.DataFrame == pd.read_csv
